# BEP028 example dataset - Provenance records for `heudiconv`

This example aims at showing provenance records for a DICOM to Nifti conversion, performed by [`heudiconv`](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Provenance records were created manually ; they act as a guideline for further machine-generated records by `heudiconv`. 

After conversion, and adding provenance traces, the directory tree is as follows:

```

```

About symbols:
* files with a ⭐ were generated by `heudiconv` ;
* files with a ✍️ were generated manually ;
* files with ⭐✍️ were generated by `heudiconv` and then edited by hand.

Note that the `sourcedata/` directory contains the source dataset (DICOM files) known as [hirni-demo](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/hirni-demo).
